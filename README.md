# Google Project Management Certificate Templates (Curated & Portfolio-Ready)

Hi, this is Anteneh. Here's a list of useful templates I keep using from the **Google Project Management Professional Certificate (Coursera)**.  

This is designed for learners, entry-level project managers, NGOs, startups, and academic programs seeking **industry-aligned project documentation**.

This repository focuses on **real-world usability**, **portfolio readiness**, and **clear project lifecycle alignment**.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Many learners, like me, complete the Google Project Management Certificate without leaving with a **cohesive, reusable template library**.

This repository solves that problem by:
- Consolidating all core **Google PM templates**
- Structuring them by **project lifecycle phase**
- Providing **clean, recruiter-readable artifacts**
- Supporting **Agile and hybrid project environments**

---

## What You’ll Find Here

This repository includes commonly used templates for:
- Project initiation and stakeholder management
- Project planning and risk management
- Execution, monitoring, and reporting
- Project closure and lessons learned documentation

All templates are compatible with **Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides**.

---

## Project Lifecycle Coverage

| Project Phase | Templates Included |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Initiation | Project Charter, Stakeholder Analysis Matrix |
| Planning | Project Plan, RACI Matrix, Risk Register, Communication Plan |
| Execution | Project Status Reports, Change Request Log |

| Closure | Closeout Report, Lessons Learned Register |

This lifecycle structure mirrors how **entry-level project managers** are expected to document projects in real organizations.
